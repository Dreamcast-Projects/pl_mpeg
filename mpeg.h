/**
    MPEG1 Decode Library for Dreamcast - Version 0.8 (2023/09/19)
    Originally ported by Tashi (aka Twada)
    Further works done by Ian Robinson and Andy Barajas

    Overview:
    This library facilitates the playback of MPEG1 videos on the Sega Dreamcast console.
    It supports monaural audio and allows specifying a cancel button during playback.

    Key Features:
    - Video Playback: MPEG1 video playback.
    - Audio Support: Mono audio playback. Stereo videos will play only the left channel.
    - Cancel Button: Allows specifying a controller button combination to cancel playback.
    - Recommended Resolutions:
      - 4:3 Aspect Ratio: 320x240 pixels, Mono audio at 80kbits.
      - 16:9 Aspect Ratio: 368x208 pixels, Mono audio at 80kbits.

    To create compatible MPEG1 videos, use the following ffmpeg command:

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=320:240" -b:v 742k -minrate 742k -maxrate 742k -bufsize 742k -ac 1 -ar 32000 -c:a mp2 -b:a 64k -f mpeg output.mpg

    \param  player          The MPEG player instance used for playback. Must be initialized.
    \param  cancel_buttons  A bit mask of controller buttons that can cancel the playback.
