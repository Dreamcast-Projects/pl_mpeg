/**
    MPEG1 Decode Library for Dreamcast - Version 0.8 (2023/09/19)
    Originally ported by Tashi (aka Twada)
    Further edits done by Ian Robinson and Andy Barajas

    Overview:
    This library facilitates the playback of MPEG1 videos on the Sega Dreamcast console.
    It supports monaural audio and allows specifying a cancel button during playback.

    Key Features:
    - Video Playback: MPEG1 video playback.
    - Audio Support: Mono audio playback. Stereo videos will play only the left channel.
    - Cancel Button: Allows specifying a controller button combination to cancel playback.
    - Recommended Resolutions:
      - 4:3 Aspect Ratio: 320x240 pixels, Mono audio at 80kbits.
      - 16:9 Aspect Ratio: 368x208 pixels, Mono audio at 80kbits.

    To create compatible MPEG1 videos, use the following ffmpeg command:

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=320:240" -b:v 742k -minrate 742k -maxrate 742k -bufsize 742k -ac 1 -ar 32000 -c:a mp2 -b:a 64k -f mpeg output.mpg

/**
    \defgroup mpeg_memory_management Memory Management Customization
    \ingroup mpeg_playback

    This library allows the use of custom memory allocation routines by defining a
    set of macros **before** including the MPEG header. This is useful for integrating
    with custom allocators, memory tracking systems, or memory pools (e.g. in-game memory arenas).

    If you wish to override **any** of the memory macros below, you **must define all of them** to ensure
    consistent behavior and prevent mismatched allocation/free errors.
    ---
    ### General Memory Allocation

    These macros control how memory is allocated for internal MPEG player structures,
    decoder state, and temporary buffers allocated on the SH-4 side:

    If not defined, the library will default to standard libc functions:
    ```c
    #define MPEG_MALLOC(sz)        malloc(sz)
    #define MPEG_FREE(p)           free(p)
    #define MPEG_REALLOC(p, sz)    realloc((p), (sz))
    #define MPEG_MEMALIGN(a, sz)   memalign((a), (sz))
    ```
    ---
    ### PVR (Video) Memory Allocation

    These macros control how video frame textures are allocated in PVR (Video RAM):

    If not defined, the library uses KallistiOS PVR memory functions:
    ```c
    #define MPEG_PVR_MALLOC(sz)    pvr_mem_malloc(sz)
    #define MPEG_PVR_FREE(p)       pvr_mem_free(p)
    ```
    ---
    ### Custom Usage Example

    To use your own memory functions, define all of the following before including `mpeg.h`:

    ```c
    #define MPEG_MALLOC(sz)        my_malloc(sz)
    #define MPEG_FREE(p)           my_free(p)
    #define MPEG_REALLOC(p, sz)    my_realloc((p), (sz))
    #define MPEG_MEMALIGN(a, sz)   my_memalign((a), (sz))

    #define MPEG_PVR_MALLOC(sz)    my_pvr_alloc(sz)
    #define MPEG_PVR_FREE(p)       my_pvr_free(p)

    #include "mpeg.h"
    ```

    Failing to define the **full set** will result in compile error.
