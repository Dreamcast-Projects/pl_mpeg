/**
    MPEG1 Decode Library for Dreamcast - Version 0.8 (2023/09/19)
    Originally ported by Tashi (aka Twada)
    Further edits done by Ian Robinson and Andy Barajas

    Overview:
    This library facilitates the playback of MPEG1 videos on the Sega Dreamcast console.
    It supports monaural audio and allows specifying a cancel button during playback.

    Key Features:
    - Video Playback: MPEG1 video playback.
    - Audio Support: Mono audio playback. Stereo videos will play only the left channel.
    - Cancel Button: Allows specifying a controller button combination to cancel playback.
    - Recommended Resolutions:
      - 4:3 Aspect Ratio: 320x240 pixels, Mono audio at 80kbits.
      - 16:9 Aspect Ratio: 368x208 pixels, Mono audio at 80kbits.

    To create compatible MPEG1 videos, use the following ffmpeg command:

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=320:240" -b:v 742k -minrate 742k -maxrate 742k -bufsize 742k -ac 1 -ar 32000 -c:a mp2 -b:a 64k -f mpeg output.mpg

    \defgroup mpeg_customization Build-Time Customization
    \ingroup mpeg_playback

    The MPEG playback library supports compile-time customization of memory allocation,
    video RAM usage, and file I/O. This is done via a set of macros that must be defined
    **before including `mpeg.h`**.

    ---
    ## Memory Allocation (`MPEG_*` macros)

    These control how memory is allocated on the SH-4 side for the MPEG player and decoder.

    If you do not define them, the following defaults are used:

    ```c
    #define MPEG_MALLOC(sz)        malloc(sz)
    #define MPEG_FREE(p)           free(p)
    #define MPEG_REALLOC(p, sz)    realloc((p), (sz))
    #define MPEG_MEMALIGN(a, sz)   memalign((a), (sz))
    #define MPEG_MEMZERO(p, sz)    memset((p), 0, (sz))
    ```

    If you override **any** of these, you **must override all five**.

    ---
    ## PVR (Video RAM) Allocation (`MPEG_PVR_*` macros)

    These control how textures (video frames) are allocated in VRAM.

    Defaults:

    ```c
    #define MPEG_PVR_MALLOC(sz)    pvr_mem_malloc(sz)
    #define MPEG_PVR_FREE(p)       pvr_mem_free(p)
    ```

    If you override one, you must override both.

    ---
    ## File I/O (`MPEG_FILE_*` macros)

    These define how the MPEG decoder opens and reads MPEG files.

    If none are defined, the library uses KallistiOS file I/O:

    ```c
    #define MPEG_FILE_TYPE                 file_t
    #define MPEG_FILE_INVALID_HANDLE       FILEHND_INVALID
    #define MPEG_FILE_OPEN(fn)             fs_open((fn), O_RDONLY)
    #define MPEG_FILE_CLOSE(fh)            fs_close((fh))
    #define MPEG_FILE_SEEK(fh, off, st)    fs_seek((fh), (off), (st))
    #define MPEG_FILE_READ(fh, buf, size)  fs_read((fh), (buf), (size))
    #define MPEG_FILE_TELL(fh)             fs_tell((fh))
    ```

    If you override **any one** of these macros, you must override **all seven** to ensure compatibility and prevent undefined behavior.

    ---
    ## Compile-time Enforcement

    If you attempt a partial override (e.g. redefine only one macro from a group), compilation will fail with an error message. This ensures:

    - Proper pairing of allocation and free functions
    - Consistent file handle semantics
    - Prevention of subtle memory or I/O bugs

    Always define the **entire macro group** when customizing behavior.
